# Go Boilerplate Repository

This repository provides a boilerplate for Go (Golang) projects, designed to provide a quick start for new applications with a robust and scalable structure. It includes a set of best practices, tools, and configurations allowing developers to focus more on writing business logic rather than setting up a project.

## Features

- **Standard Project Layout**:

  - The project follows the Standard Go Project Layout which is the standard layout in the Go ecosystem.

      ```/myapp
        /cmd
            main.go
        /infra
          /database
            gorm.go
          /environment
            environment.go
          /rest
            rest.go
        /modules
          /health
        /utils
        go.mod
        go.sum
        README.md
      ```

- **Dependency Management**:

  - This boilerplate uses Go Modules for managing dependencies, which is the official dependency management solution in Go.

## Getting Started
